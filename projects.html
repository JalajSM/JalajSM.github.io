      <p>
        As part of my senior capstone at Columbia, I worked on developing phase diagrams for organic liquid electrolyte systems
        (LiPF6 in EC/DMC and EC/DEC solvents) used in next-generation batteries. The goal was to create lighter, more energy-dense
        electrochemical cells using SPAN anodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built a comprehensive Python data pipeline that processes raw DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) heat ramp data,
        automatically detects phase transition peaks using adaptive search algorithms, and maps them to composition data. The pipeline
        generates binary and ternary phase diagrams, and uses KNN imputation and Random Forest regression models to interpolate
        missing data points and predict solidus/liquidus lines across the full composition range.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key technical contributions include an adaptive peak-finding algorithm that ranks candidates by weighted slope and magnitude scores,
        automated processing of dozens of XLS data files with different compositions, and publication-quality visualization of phase boundaries.

      <p>
        Over two years in the Gang Lab at Columbia and as a visiting researcher at Brookhaven National Lab,
        I established a novel procedure to metalize DNA crystal lattices via infiltration with iron oxide.
        This research explored the use of DNA as a programmable scaffold for creating 3D nanostructured materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        I synthesized DNA crystals and characterized them extensively using scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
        transmission electron microscopy (TEM), focused ion beam (FIB) milling, optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD),
        and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). I also developed nanoindentation testing protocols to evaluate
        the mechanical properties of these crystals, and created methods to derive elastic modulus and hardness from raw
        indentation data.

      <p>
        During my fellowship at the National Energy Technology Laboratory (part of the U.S. Department of Energy),
        I developed a Python program for automated image processing of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
        of metal alloy microstructures.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program implements 3D matrix mathematics to calculate crystal grain misorientation angles and axes from
        diffraction pattern data. I packaged the tool into a standalone executable with a Tkinter-based graphical
        user interface so that researchers without programming experience could use it. The work was presented at a
        Department of Energy Symposium in Washington, D.C.

        PhotoLearn is an interactive web application that teaches photography fundamentals through hands-on simulators,
        quizzes, and a creative playground. Built as part of Columbia's User Interface Design course (COMS W 4170),
        the app features real-time camera setting simulators for ISO, aperture, and shutter speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key features include a step-by-step learning flow with interactive simulators and progress tracking,
        a quiz system with simulator-based and scenario-based questions, and a playground mode where users can
        upload their own images and experiment with camera settings in real time. The frontend is built with
        Next.js/React/TypeScript, and a Flask backend provides API extensibility.

        A technical writing sample exploring the increasing thermal management challenges in the semiconductor industry.
        The piece covers the physics of heat generation in modern chips (dynamic power dissipation, leakage currents,
        and electromigration), and examines two frontier solutions: topological semimetals (TSMs) as alternatives
        to copper interconnects, and biomimetic microfluidic cooling systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article discusses how TSMs resist surface scattering at the nanoscale due to their unique Fermi arc
        surface states, and how microfluidic channels etched directly into silicon chips can reduce peak temperatures
        by up to 65%. Both approaches represent cutting-edge materials science applied to one of computing's
        most pressing bottlenecks.

      <p>
        During the Garcia Research Program at SUNY Stony Brook, I developed biodegradable hydrogel flame retardants
        from physically cross-linked PVA bases with embedded starch and RDP particles. The work resulted in a
        peer-reviewed publication in the American Chemical Society's <em>Biomacromolecules</em> journal (2021):
        "Synthesis of an Effective Flame-Retardant Hydrogel for Skin Protection Using Xanthan Gum and Resorcinol
        Bis(diphenyl phosphate)-Coated Starch."
      </p>
      <p>
        I also analyzed UIO-66 metal-organic frameworks through the Lattice Boltzmann model to develop plausible
        reaction mechanisms for carbon capture and predict trends in diffusion coefficient changes.
        This work was presented at the Fall 2019 Materials Research Society Conference in Boston.
